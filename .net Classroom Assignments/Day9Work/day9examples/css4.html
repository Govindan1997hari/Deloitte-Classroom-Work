        Being a PC gamer is an inherently social experience. Even if you're not into multiplayer games, there's a good chance that you have a few subreddits, forums, and comment sections you like to hang around in. It's a great way to expose yourself to new games and opinions you might not have considered, but finding the right community isn't easy. Lively, respectful conversation can be a hard thing to find. That's why we've rounded up our favorite PC gaming communities to hang out in.If you can forgive us for tooting our own horns for a second, the PC Gamer Club is the coolest place to hang out since treehouses were invented. While you get a ton of perks for signing up, the most relevant one is access to our Discord server, a bumping place where just under a thousand PC gamers are chatting and making friends. There's dedicated lobbies for specific games, so finding a party is easy, and we also host a ton of giveaways. We're proud of the community we've created and the lively discussion happening every minute about everything PC gaming.
